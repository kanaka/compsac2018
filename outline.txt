  * Simple PBT Example [fragment #1]
    . Input properties: A is an integer, B is an integer
    . Output property: C is the sum of A and B

    Here is a very simple example of PBT properties.

    Property-based testing is often explained in the context of
    functional testing where testing is performed at the function
    level. However, PBT also works well for testing at a system level.
    In this case the input properties may be complex generators and
    the output properties may be non-trivial test Oracles. In
    particular, the test-shrinking capability of property-based
    testing is very useful whether testing is at a functional level or
    a whole system level.
